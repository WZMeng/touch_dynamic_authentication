touch dynamic user authentication based on user behaviors

In this project, we employ behavioral biometric methods and mainly focus on a novel user behavioral biometric, namely touch dynamics, which refers to collecting detailed information about individual touches, such as touch duration and touch direction. The goal is to use touch dynamics on touchscreen mobile phones to enhance user authentication. 

The modified OS is attached.
